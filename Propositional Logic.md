# Overview

A *proposition* is a declarative sentence that is either *true* ($T$) or *false* ($F$). 

## Logical Operators

These include the following:

-  Negation | *OR* | 

# Predicates

Predicates become porpositions (with truth values) when their vairables are replaced by a value in the *domain* (bound by a [[#Quanifier]]).

$P(x)$ is said to be the value of  the Predicate *P at x*.

*Domain* is often noted by $U$.

e.g.  let $P(x)$ denote *x>0*

$P(1)$ -> True
$P(0)$ -> False
$P(3)$ -> True

> The domain $U$ would be any integer
