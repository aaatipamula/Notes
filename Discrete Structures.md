**Prologue**:
- Add collaborators
	- Explain code that was worked on collaboratively extensively

# Overview

## Discrete Math

Math that deals with discrete values (integers, steps taken by a program, distinct paths, etc.). This type of math is subsequently used in most other computer science concepts.

Problems that could be solved with discrete math:
- How many ways can a password be chosen following specific rules..
- Encrypting a message.
- Building a circuit that adds two integers.
- Is there a link between two computers in a network?
- Proving a sorting algorithm accurately sorts a set of values.

## Goals

- Mathematical Reasoning: Read, understand, and construct proofs
- Combinatorial Analysis: Techniques for counting objects.
- Discrete Structures:
