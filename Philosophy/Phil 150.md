[[What Philosophers Do]]

## [[Speech Act Theory]]

- J.L. Austin

## Grice v.s. Austin

Both account for the space between the literal meaning of words. And what utterances do to linguistic communication.

Grice:
	What do I want to express - what is the best way to express it?

Austin:
	- What social conditions/procedures have to be in place for an illocutionary act to work?

## Public Monuments

## Discursive Injustice
- A speaker cannot perform certain speech acts that she out to be able to perform because of a systematic effect of having a underprivileged social position
- Austin's uptake: *"the understanding of the meaning and of the force of the locution"*

Bianchi's approach to discursive Injustice
- The speaker may failed to perform a speech act only because their addressee is inattentive, incompetent, or biased, Uptake is primarily dependent on the hearer. 

## Harm With Words

### Harm via Persuasion: 
I can persuade some people to hold a harmful idea

### Harm via R---

Harm caused by enacting norms that prescribe a harmful practice

### McGowan's view on More Speech

proper remedy for harmful speech is more speech

Limitations: 
Places the burden of remedy on those targeted (potentially harmed) by the allegedly harmful speech.

Second the efficacy of "more speech" response is controversial 

Credibility defecits and lack of conceptual resource there is a case of "self-silences". E.G. because a speaker knows the audience will get something wrong they choose to remain silent.
