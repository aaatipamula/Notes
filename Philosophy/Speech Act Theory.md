
Sometimes the words we utter are actions.

Description of actions e.g. 
	- I *pronounce* you husband and wife.
	- I *promise* I'll pay you back of the movie ticket.
	- I *bet* you $10 that I catch covid before the semester is over.

Actual action e.g.
	- It's super spicy (Warning Spice)
	- I have a lot of assignments I need to get done. (Declining invitation)

## Three Kinds of Speech Act

1. Locutionary Act
	Saying Something. 
	Meaningfully asking of something
 
	e.g. "Is there any salt here?" (Sincerely asking if there is salt)
 
2. Illocutionary Act
	Context sensitive.
	
	e.g. "Is there any salt here" (Requesting salt to be passed )
 
3. Perlocutionary Act
	"Is there any salt here" ()


### Locutionary and Illocutionary Acts

*Not every illocutionary act comes with a locutionary act*

### Illocutionary and Perlocutionary Acts

They can come apart. Illocutionary act may fail to bring about the intended perlocutionary act.

e.g.
	I warn you about something, but you don't heed the warning ("Don't touch that!")

## Locutionary and Illocutionary Silencing

Locutionary Silencing: Preventing person's ability to express.

Illocutionary Silencing: begin silenced by being prevented from doing things with your words.

## Undercutting Recognition
- Illocutionary acts can be undercut due to social/cultural conventions.
- They can also be undercut by the people outside the audience.
