# Curves

These are 2D shapes that may make up the cross sectional of a [[#Surfaces|surface]].

##  Ellipses

These are shapes such as an *oval* or *circle*.

General Form:

$$\left(\frac{x-h}{A}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y-k}{B}\right)^2=1$$
> $A$ and $B$ are constants.

## Hyperbola

There are two different types of hyperbolas, ones with a [vertical asymptote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote#Vertical_asymptotes) ([[#Type I]] )and ones with a [horizontal asymptote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote#Horizontal_asymptotes) ([[#Type II]]).

### Type I

As mentioned before these have a vertical asymptote. 

General Form:

### Type II

As mentioned before these have a horizontal asymptote. 

General Form:
# Surfaces
> $A$, $B$  and $C$ are constants.

## Ellipsoid

The *Cross-sectionals* of these shapes are either *ellipses* or points.

They generally follow the form: 

$$\left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y}{B}\right)^2+\left(\frac{z}{C}\right)^2=c$$

## Elliptic Paraboloid

They generally follow the form: 

$$z=\left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y}{B}\right)^2$$

Variables can be swapped the variable that is equal to the other two squared summed will be the direction of the concavity (hollow part of the cup).

## Hyperbolic Paraboloid (Saddle)

They generally follow the form: 

$$z=\left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2-\left(\frac{y}{B}\right)^2$$

## Hyperboloid of One Sheet

They generally follow the form: 

$$\left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y}{B}\right)^2=\left(\frac{z}{C}\right)^2+c$$

## Hyperboloid of Two Sheet

They generally follow the form: 

$$\left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y}{B}\right)^2=\left(\frac{z}{C}\right)^2-c$$

## Cone

They generally follow the form: 

$$\left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y}{B}\right)^2=\left(\frac{z}{C}\right)^2$$
