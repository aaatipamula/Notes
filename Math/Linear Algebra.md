# Overview

As the name suggest this focuses on [Linear Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) explicitly.

## *Systems* of *Linear Equations*

**All** linear equations will fall under one of these three types of solutions:
1. No Solution
2. One Unique Solution
3. $\infty$ many solutions

> NOTE: This will not occur for *non-linear* equations
