# Overview

As the name suggest this focuses on [Linear Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) explicitly.

## *Systems* of *Linear Equations*

**All** linear equations will fall under one of these three types of solutions:
1. No Solution
2. One Unique Solution
3. $\infty$ many solutions

> NOTE: This will not occur for *non-linear* equations

### Solving Systems of Linear Equations

Linear equations should only be simplified using invertible processes. This can be one of the three following operations:
- Changing the order of equations.
- Multiply an equation by an a *non-zero* constant.
- Add or subtract a multiple of an equation to another.

# Notation

## Definitions:

**Augmented Matrices**:

**Echelon Form**:

**Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**:

A matrix is reduced if:
- It is in [[echelon]] form.
- A leading $1$ is the only non-zero value in the row.

## Theorems

---

Using  row elimination operations, any system can be simplfied in *RREF*. Moreover this reduced form is **unique**.
> This process is also called **Gaussian Elim
