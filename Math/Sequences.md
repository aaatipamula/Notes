# Overview

A sequence is a series of numbers that increase by a positive integer $n$

This can be represented by the notation: $$a_n=n$$

To find if a sequence *converges* or *diverges* you can take the limit of the sequence and treat the value $n$ as a variable $x$ such that: 

$$\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$$
