Limits can be calculated using this rule *only* if they take one of the two [[Limits#Indeterminate Forms|indeterminate forms]]: 

$$\frac{0}{0}\quad\frac{\pm\infty}{\pm\infty}$$

If the previous condition is met the derivative of the function in the numerator over the derivative of the function in the denominator will give you the value of the limit. 

$$lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$

e.g. given $\lim_{x\to1}\frac{\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}x)}{\sin(\pi x)}$ the solution is as following: 

$$
\lim_{x\to1}\frac{\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}x)}{\sin(\pi x)}=\lim_{x\to1}\frac{-\frac{\pi}{2}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}x)}{\pi \cos(\pi x)}$$

From there you can simply [[#Direct Substitution|directly substitute]] to get the solution.
