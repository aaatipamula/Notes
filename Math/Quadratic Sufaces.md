# Ellipses

These are shapes such as an *oval* or *circle*.

They generally follow the form:

$$\left(\frac{x-h}{A}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y-k}{B}\right)^2=1$$
> $A$ and $B$ are constants.

# Ellipsoid

The *Cross-sectionals* of these shapes are either *ellipses* or points.

They generally follow the form: 

$${\frac{x}{A}}^2+{\frac{y}{B}}^2+{\frac{z}{C}}^2=1$$
> $A$, $B$  and $C$ are constants.
