Limits can be calculated by simply plugging in the value that the limit is approaching. This should be the *first* method of trying to solve a limit

Given $f(x)=3x^2+x+4$ to find $\lim_{x\to3}f(x)$ you can simply substitute the value 3 into the function $f(x)$. 
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to3}3x^2+x+4&=3(3)^2+3+4\\
&=34
\end{align*}$$
