# Overview

This is simply just using calculus on functions with multiple input variables. 

Traditionally we would work with functions with one input $x$ like in $f(x)$. This instead works with functions with multiple input variables $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that the function is defined as $f(x, y, x)$
