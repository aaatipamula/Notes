# Overview

Planes are a 2D surface that can be represented in 3D.

**The equation of a plane can be found using an orthogonal vector $\vec{n}$ and a point $P$ that exists in the plane.**

Assuming the orthogonal vector to the plane $\vec{n}=\langle A,B,C\rangle$ and a point $P=(a,b,c)$ exists on the plane.
