# Overview

Planes are a 2D surface that can be represented in 3D.

**The equation of a plane can be found using an orthogonal vector $\vec{n}$ and a point $P$ that exists in the plane.**

Assuming the normal [[Vectors|vector]] to the plane $\vec{n}=\langle A,B,C\rangle$ and a point $P=(a,b,c)$ exists on the plane the equation of the plane is:

$$A(x-a)+B(y-b)+C(z-c)=0$$

e.g. Given $\vec{n}=\langle3,7,1\rangle$ and point $P=(3,9,0)$ exists on the the pl
